        <h2>Domain 1: Cloud Concepts (24%)</h2>
        
        <h3>What is Cloud Computing?</h3>
        <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.</p>
        
        <h3>Six Advantages of Cloud Computing</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Trade capital expense for variable expense</strong> - Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you're going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Benefit from massive economies of scale</strong> - By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own.</li>
            <li><strong>Stop guessing capacity</strong> - Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity.</li>
            <li><strong>Increase speed and agility</strong> - In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers</strong> - Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Go global in minutes</strong> - Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Types of Cloud Computing</h3>
        <div class="service-grid">
            <div class="service-card">
                <h4>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h4>
                <p>Contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. Provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Amazon EC2, Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine</p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-card">
                <h4>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h4>
                <p>Removes the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure. Focus on the deployment and management of your applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Services, Google App Engine</p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-card">
                <h4>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h4>
                <p>Provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> AWS WorkMail, Microsoft Office 365, Google G Suite</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Cloud Deployment Models</h3>
        <div class="service-grid">
            <div class="service-card">
                <h4>Public Cloud</h4>
                <p>A cloud environment owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, which delivers their computing resources like servers and storage over the Internet.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform</p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-card">
                <h4>Private Cloud</h4>
                <p>Cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site data center, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> VMware Cloud, OpenStack</p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-card">
                <h4>Hybrid Cloud</h4>
                <p>Computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> AWS Outposts, Azure Arc, Google Anthos</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>AWS Global Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>AWS builds its infrastructure in a way that provides high availability and fault tolerance while also allowing for global scalability.</p>
        
        <h4>Regions</h4>
        <p>A physical location in the world where AWS clusters data centers. Each group of logical data centers is called an Availability Zone (AZ). Each AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate AZs within a geographic area.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Key Points About Regions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each region is completely independent</li>
                <li>Each region has at least 2 AZs</li>
                <li>Not all AWS services are available in all regions</li>
                <li>AWS largest region is US-EAST (N. Virginia)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Availability Zones (AZs)</h4>
        <p>An AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region. AZs are physically separated by a meaningful distance (miles) from any other AZ, although all are within 60 miles (100 km) of each other.</p>
        
        <h4>Edge Locations</h4>
        <p>Edge locations are sites that Amazon CloudFront uses to cache copies of content for faster delivery to users. They're separate from Regions and AZs and are typically deployed in major cities and highly populated areas.</p>
        
        <h3>Well-Architected Framework</h3>
        <p>The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications and workloads. It's based on six pillars:</p>

            </div>
            <div class="service-card">
                <h4>Reliability</h4>
                <p>The ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-card">
                <h4>Performance Efficiency</h4>
                <p>The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-card">
                <h4>Cost Optimization</h4>
                <p>The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.</p>
            </div>

        <h2>Domain 2: Security and Compliance (30%)</h2>
        
        <h3>Shared Responsibility Model</h3>
        <p>Security and compliance are shared responsibilities between AWS and the customer. AWS is responsible for "security of the cloud" (infrastructure), while customers are responsible for "security in the cloud" (data and configurations).</p>
        
        <div class="service-grid">
            <div class="service-card">
                <h4>AWS Responsibilities</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Physical security of data centers</li>
                    <li>Hardware and infrastructure</li>
                    <li>Network infrastructure</li>
                    <li>Virtualization infrastructure</li>
                    <li>Software for managed services</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="service-card">
                <h4>Customer Responsibilities</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data encryption</li>
                    <li>Network traffic protection</li>
                    <li>Operating system, network, and firewall configuration</li>
                    <li>Identity and access management</li>
                    <li>Customer data</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="highlight important">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> The shared responsibility model shifts depending on the service. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For EC2, AWS manages the infrastructure, and customers manage the OS and applications</li>
                <li>For RDS, AWS manages the infrastructure and the database software</li>
                <li>For Lambda, AWS manages everything except the code and access controls</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h3>
        <p>IAM is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. It enables you to create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow or deny their access to AWS resources.</p>
        
        <h4>Key IAM Concepts</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Users</strong> - Individuals who interact with AWS resources</li>
            <li><strong>Groups</strong> - Collections of users with shared permissions</li>
            <li><strong>Roles</strong> - Sets of permissions that can be assumed by users, applications, or services</li>
            <li><strong>Policies</strong> - Documents that define permissions (written in JSON)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>IAM Best Practices</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Lock away your AWS account root user access keys</li>
            <li>Use IAM roles for applications that run on EC2 instances</li>
            <li>Grant least privilege</li>
            <li>Enable MFA for privileged users</li>
            <li>Use policy conditions for extra security</li>
            <li>Rotate credentials regularly</li>
        </ul>
